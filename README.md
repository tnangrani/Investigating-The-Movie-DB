# Investigating-The-Movie-DB

In this Udacity project I will be exploring the The Movie Database (TMDb) data set. This data set contains information for over 10,000 films, including revenue, ratings, casts and genres. I will be using Python libraries Numpy, pandas and Matplotlib to perform the analysis.

The key objectives for this project are listed below:
- Understand and apply the steps of the data analysis process;
- Pose meaningful questions around the data and apply EDA techniques to answer those questions;
- Wrangle the data into a usable format for investigation;
- Apply vectorized methods in Numpy and pandas for efficient code;
- Understand and work with with pandas series and DataFrame objects; and
- Produce plots and visualisations using Matplotlib.

The analysis will be focusing on genre popularity, profitability and the activity of production companies. In particular, the questions I will be exploring include:

1) Which Primary Genres are the most popular (i.e. highest average popularity score)?

2) Which production companies have produced the most films since the inception of the data set and what is the percentage breakdown of major production company activity?

3) Which Primary Genre had the highest average profit (inflation-adjusted) and which film was the most profitable overall (inflation-adjusted)?
